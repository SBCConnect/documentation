# Adding a new holiday schedule to Microsoft Teams.



## Steps to Create a Holiday Schedule
1. Log into the **Microsoft Teams Admin Portal**
   - https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/

1. Go to **Org-wide settings** > **Holidays**

1. Click on **Add** to setup a new holiday.

1. Enter a name for the holiday and select new date. 

1. Under **Start time**, select the calendar icon and choose the date when you'd like the holiday to begin.

1. Use the drop-down list to select a start time for the holiday.

1.	Under **End time**, select the calendar icon and choose the date when you'd like the holiday to end.

1. Use the drop-down list to select an end time for the holiday. The **End time** must be after the **Start time**.
   
   **NOTE:**
   *If the holiday is for one full day (i.e., a 24 hour period), the End time should be set to the next day and the time to 12:00 AM. For example, if your organization is closed on January 1 for New Year's day, set the Start time to January 1 12:00 AM and set the End time to January 2 @ 12:00 AM.*

1. Optionally, add more dates for recurring holidays.
