# Add a new PSTN Gateway for Direct Routing
A PSTN Gateway is a configuration item within Microsoft Teams that enables Teams to tell where to route inbound calls to and where to send calls when an outboud call is made.

There may be more than one PSTN gateway required by the platform. Please refer to the configuration information supplied by the platform team.

## Required Information
- PSTN gateway FQDN
- Gateway port
- Maximum concurrent channels

## Troubleshooting
> Can not use the "{GATEWAY}" domain as it was not configured for this tenant

After adding the domain to the Microsoft Admin Portal, you must create a new user using the new domain as their primary username domain and assign the user an E3 or E5 license. The activation might take between 20 minutes and 48 hours before the command will run without error.

## PowerShell
**You need to update the following details in the three (3) lines below**
- {GATEWAY} - The FQDN of the gateway
- {PORT} - The port used by the gateway
- {CHANNELS} - The maximum number of channels supported by the gateway
