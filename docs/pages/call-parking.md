# Call Parking
Call holds can be either performed by placing the call
- on hold where the same person will pick up the call; or
- on Call Park so someone else can pickup the call.

Call Parking is good for when someone receives a call and needs a person in a department to answer the call.
For example, if someone called a supermarket and wanted to speak to someone in the bakery:
- the call operator could place the call on Call Park
- the operator would be receive a park code (IE: 15)
- the operator could announce to over the shops PA system asking for someone in the bakery to pickup call 15
- someone in the bakery could pickup call 15
