## Common Voice mailboxes
Common Voicemails in the SBC Platform are refered to as a voice mailbox that isn't attached to a user.
For example a company might need a common voice mailbox for the general receipt of voicemails as an overflow option during the day or 
for capturing calls after hours.

Both scenarious could be a delivered as a single common voice mailbox or multiple common voice mailboxes.

Calls can only be transfered to a common voice mailboxes from within an Auto Attendant. Transfers from a Call Queue or from a user initiated transfer are not possible.

### Requirements
A Common Voice Mailbox is delivered using a Microsoft 365 Group. After configuring a Microsoft 365 Group, you're able to select it as a Voicemail routing option from an Auto Attendant.

### Setup a common voice mailbox
If you're planning to deliver voicemails to a user or shared mailbox, then this may change the members of the group. Please read [Receiving Common Voicemails](#receiving-common-voicemails) in before proceeding with creating the group. 
- Create a Microsoft 365 Group from the Microsoft Admin Portal
  - üåê https://admin.microsoft.com
  - This group can be the same as a group used for call queue members
- Add members to the group that you wish to have access to the voicemails
- In an Auto Attendant, Select **Redirect to** > **Voice Mail** then select the Microsoft 365 group

### Receiving Common Voicemails
Voicemails delivered to Common Voice Mailboxes can **only** be delivered to an Office 365 Group, however it is possible to get these emails forwarded to another mailbox, including a User or Shared Mailbox.\
This forwarding will need to be done by a service account in the tenant with a Microsoft Flow license. Refer to the [Licensing](#licensing-for-common-voicemails) section below.

### Configuring voicemail redirection to a User or Shared Mailbox
Because voicemails can only be delivered to a Microsoft 365 group, this severly impacts the usability of the product as emails as part of a group can't easily be deleted, marked complete, moved to another folder, etc etc.\
Customers may choose to have these voicemails forwarded from the group to a shared mailbox using the Microsoft Power Automate platform. From here you can create a tasks that triggers everytime an email is recevied and then forward that onto another mailbox.

**Steps**
- Log into the Microsft Power Automate website as a licensed user
  - http://flow.microsoft.com
- Create a new Flow
- Add a trigger called **
