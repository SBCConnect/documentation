## Common Voice mailboxes
Common Voicemails in the SBC Platform are refered to as a voice mailbox that isn't attached to a user.
For example a company might need a common voice mailbox for the general receipt of voicemails as an overflow option during the day or 
for capturing calls after hours.

Both scenarious could be a delivered as a single common voice mailbox or multiple common voice mailboxes.

Calls can only be transfered to a common voice mailboxes from within an Auto Attendant. Transfers from a Call Queue or from a user initiated transfer are not possible.

### Requirements
A Common Voice Mailbox is delivered using a Microsoft 365 Group. After configuring a Microsoft 365 Group, you're able to select it as a Voicemail routing option from an Auto Attendant.

### Setup a common voice mailbox
- Create a Microsoft 365 Group from the Microsoft Admin Portal
  - üåê https://admin.microsoft.com
  - This group can be the same as a group used for call queue members
- Add members to the group that you wish to have access to the voicemails
- In an Auto Attendant, Select **Redirect to** > **Voice Mail** then select the Microsoft 365 group

### Licensing
License requirements are listed under **Common Voice Mailboxes** üåê [Here](pages/License-Requirements.md#common-voice-mailboxes)
