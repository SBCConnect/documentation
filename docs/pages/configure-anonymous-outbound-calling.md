# Configure outbound anonymous calling policies
Outbound anonymous calling can be configured in multiple ways

- **Anonymous Per-User Forced**
  - This policy can be provisioned per user and set's their outbound number to Anonymous/Private. As a result, the user is unable to configure if their number is shown or not when making an outboud call
- **Anonymous Per-User User Selected**
  - This policy can be provisioned per user and allows the user to choose to set their outbound number to Anonymous/Private. The user is able to change this setting under **Settings** > **Calls** within their Microsoft Teams client.
- **Anonymous Globally forced**
  - This policy is applied to all users by default that don't have another **per user** policy applied to them individually. When applicable to a user, the user is unable to configure if their number is shown or not when making an outboud call
- **Anonymous Globally User Selected**
  - This policy is applied to all users by default that don't have another **per user** policy applied to them individually. When applicable to a user, this policy allows the user to choose to set their outbound number to Anonymous/Private. The user is able to change this setting under **Settings** > **Calls** within their Microsoft Teams client.

The options can be set via the Teams interface or through PowerShell.

## Via PowerShell
### Per-User Policies
It's safe to deploy this script to the tenant as a whole. This will allow selection and application of the policies against the users individual profiles within the Teams Admin Centre
````PowerShell
### Per user forced
# These policies set the options for the user, and restricts the user from changing the options
# Outbound number = anonymous
New-CsCallingLineIdentity -Identity "Anonymous Per-User Forced" -CallingIdSubstitute "Anonymous" -EnableUserOverride $false -Description "This policy can be provisioned per user and set's their outbound number to Anonymous/Private. As a result, the user is unable to configure if their number is shown or not when making an outboud call"
# Outbound number = Users phone number
New-CsCallingLineIdentity -Identity "Users Number Per-User Forced" -CallingIdSubstitute "LineUri" -EnableUserOverride $false -Description "This policy can be provisioned per user and set's their outbound number to their assigned PSTN dialing number. As a result, the user is unable to configure their outbound calling number within the Microsoft Teams client"

### Per user enabled
# These policies set the default options for the user, but allows the user to change options
# Outbound number = anonymous
New-CsCallingLineIdentity -Identity "Anonymous Per-User User Selected" -CallingIdSubstitute "Anonymous" -EnableUserOverride $true -Description "This policy can be provisioned per user and allows the user to choose to set their outbound number to Anonymous/Private. The user is able to change this setting under Settings > Calls within their Microsoft Teams client."

Where applicable within the tenant, the user may be able to select an alternate number as well."

### Global Policies
These policies apply as a default to all users that don't have a policy manually applied to them via the Teams Admin centre
