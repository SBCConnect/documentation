# Create a Call Queue

## Licensing
- Each Call Queue requires a resource account setup in the Microsoft 365 tenancy. These accounts are free and setup in the steps below.
- If the Call Queue is only going to be an option from an Auto Attendant, then no ruther licensing is required.
- If the Call Queue requires a phone number attached to it for direct inbound calls to the Call Queue, then you require a **Microsoft 365 Phone System - Virtual User** license. These are free and more information can be found here: üåê [Here](obtain-free-virtual-phone-system-licenses.html)

## Overview
To create a Call Queue, you need to
1. Create a Resource Account

## Steps
1. Create a Resource Account

   - Create an Office 365 Group to receive the Voice Mails (recommend to start the name of the account with VM. IE: VM Finance)
