# Create a Call Queue

## Licensing
- Each Call Queue requires a resource account setup in the Microsoft 365 tenancy. These accounts are free and setup in the steps below.
- If the Call Queue is only going to be an option from an Auto Attendant, then no ruther licensing is required.
- If the Call Queue requires a phone number attached to it for direct inbound calls to the Call Queue, then you require a **Microsoft 365 Phone System - Virtual User** license. These are free and more information can be found here: üåê [Here](obtain-free-virtual-phone-system-licenses.html)

## Overview
To create a Call Queue, you need to
1. Create a Resource Account
1. License the Resource Account (Optional)
1. Create the Call Queue

## Steps
1. Create a Resource Account
   - [Link to create a Resource Account](create-a-resource-account-user.md)
1. Assign the Resource account a license
   - [License a resource account](license-a-phone-system-resource-account.md)
1. [Optional] If wanting to forward an unanswered call to a Voice Mail, then you'll need to:
   - Need a service account with a Microsoft Flow license
   - Create an Office 365 Group to receive the Voice Mails (recommend to start the name of the account with VM. IE: VM Finance)
   - Assign the service account as an owner and member of the new Microsoft 365 group
   - Create a flow to get the email and pass it to a destination email address (See Jay for template)
1. Create the Call Queue

## PowerShell
The script will prompt for a name to use for the new Call Queue and will auto-format the name as required
