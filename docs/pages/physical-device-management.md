# Microsoft Teams Physical Device Management
There are a number of Microsoft Teams certified devices on the market from several different manufactures.\
These devices are listed on the Microsoft Teams Devices Page üåê [Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/across-devices)

Once a device is logged in and the user setup, the device is registered to the tenant and a policy applied against it from the *Configuration Profiles* listed in the *Microsoft Teams Admin Portal*.

These *Configuration Profiles* allow you to set options like the devices:
- Timeout and lock status
- Language
- Timezone
- Time format
- Screen saver
- Network settings; and
- To enable or disable the second PC port

If the Microsoft 365 tenant also has Intune setup, then the device is registered to Intune and any compliance policies are applied when the first user logs in.

Different Confiugration Profiles can be used to setup phones with common attributes

  - will **NOT** require a PIN number in order to answer an incoming call.
