# Teams Poor Call Quality Metric

The time a packet takes to be sent from 1 caller to another ultimately determines the end users experience and several factors can affect how long it takes a packet to traverse this path.

Call quality, or call delay starts to become an issue around the 75ms mark where people begin to talk over the top of each other. Then further degradation occurs around the 150ms mark where people will really start to have gaps in speech and generally will actively complain about a call.

Microsoft Teams classes calls as Good or Poor depending on several metrics. For Audio calls, these metrics are generally:
- Average packet loss of over 2%
- Average jitter in milliseconds of over 30ms
- Average ratio of the number of audio frames with concealed samples generated by packer loss healing eo the total number of audio frames being over 0.07
- Average round trip of packets in milliseconds being over 500
- Average network mean opinion score degradation for stream. How much network loss and jitter have impacted the quality of received audio being over 1.0
