Device Configuration Profiles are unable to be removed from a device once applied.\
You are, however, able to apply a new Configuration Profile to the device to override the exsiting one.

Refer to [Create a new Device Configuration Profile](pages/new-deivce-configuration-profile.md) and [Assign a Device Configuration Profile](pages/assign-deivce-configuration-profile.md) for further information.
