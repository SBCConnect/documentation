# Trouleshooting user provisioning issues

## Management object not found for identity {USERNAME}
This is often a fault found when using an on-prem server and syncing Active Directory to Azure Active Directory.\
The fault is caused by the users **Logon Name** and **pre-Windows 2000 logon name** being different.
**FIX PENDING**


## No dial pad for a voice enabled user
- Ensure that the user is correctly licensed and a number assigned
  This can be done by running the [check a users configuration](check-user-configuration.md) scripts on the SBC Connect website
- Using PowerShell, remove and re-add the Voice Routing Policy

**You need to update the following details in the two (2) lines below**
