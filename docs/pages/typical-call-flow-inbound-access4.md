# Typical inbound call flow - Provider: Access 4
This is a typical call flow and outlines the important SIP messages

|Direction | Inbound |
| ---: | :--- |
|Carrier | Access 4|

> Because SBC Connect is connected to multiple providers, you'll need to select the inbound call flow relivant to your call flow.
More examples can be found: üåê [Here](typical-call-flows.md)

### Notes on Access 4
Because the Access 4 SIP trunk is internet authenticated, then there is an additional *401 Unauthorized* in the SIP ladder that isn't nromally present in other providers, for example AAPT. This is normal and a second INVITE is used to authenticate the call.
