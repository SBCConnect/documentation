# Typical Call Flows
This page links to typical call flows that our platform sees, both from a customer and upstream provider perspective. <br>
Because the SBC Connect platform operates calls with multiple carriers, then you'll need to verify the upstream provider and use their call flow.

In addition, the platform does have failover paths for outbound calls between different providers, so if you're not seeing the expected call flow outbound, then please work through the other carriers as needed.

## Call Flows
