## How to voice enable a new or existing user
Users in Microsoft 365 require several licenses and setting changes before they are able to call using Direct Routing in Microsoft Teams

## Requirements
- Users require a **Microsoft 365 Phone System** license.\
Refer to üåê [License requriements for Microsoft Teams Direct Routing](License-Requirements.md#license-requirements-for-microsoft-teams-direct-routing) for more information.

## Modifying an existing user?
If you're looking to modify an existing user, you can re-run the same on-boarding script as below.


## PowerShell
**You need to update the following details in the two (2) lines below**
- {UPN} - User 
- {DID_NUMBER} - The number for the user in E.164 format (eg: +61255558888)

<i class="fas fa-keyboard"></i> **SBC-Easy PowerShell Code**
> ‚ö† These scripts assume that you've already connected to the **Skype for Business Online PowerShell Module**.\
