## How to voice enable a new or existing user
Users in Microsoft 365 require several licenses and setting changes before they are able to call using Direct Routing in Microsoft Teams

## Requirements
- Users require a **Microsoft 365 Phone System** license.\
Refer to üåê [License requriements for Microsoft Teams Direct Routing](License-Requirements.md#license-requirements-for-microsoft-teams-direct-routing) for more information.

## Modifying an existing user?
If you're looking to modify an existing user, see [Modify an existing users account](modify-exsiting-user-account.md)\
Example modifications include:
- Enable or disable hosted voicemail
- Change their DID phone number
- Add/remove/change an extention for their account

## PowerShell
**You need to update the following details in the two (2) lines below**
- {UPN} - User 
- {DID_NUMBER} - The number for the user in E.164 format (eg: +61255558888)

#Grant the user a Voice Policy
